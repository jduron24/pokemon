This prrgram builds off the last assignment, its supposeed to create a whole world with maps in each space. It's also supposed to 
connect each map with eachother. It also introduces scanf, which allows the user to take in inputs and directs which way the user wants to go. There are a couple bugs, in my program, like when I get to the edge of the world. I do plan on fixing them as soon as possible just to have a good base for the next project.
