This program uses dikstras algorithm to move the players closer to the PC. I was having troubles knowing where to start on implementing the priority queue. I spent most of my time fixing my dijkstras algorithm. I thought if I fixed my dijkstras, things would be easier. I was only able to assign the PC's into random spaces in the map.
